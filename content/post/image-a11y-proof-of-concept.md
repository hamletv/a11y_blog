![Ocr scan of image with text, ouput into legible text](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/raw/master/demo.gif)

## Running the Code
The image above is tesseract.js at work. It is scanning an image available online and it outputs (hopefully) legible text into the console, an alert window, a new div within your page or for my purposes: an invisible paragraph tag. This image is from the port's [repo](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js#tesseractjs) on [Github](https://www.github.com) and that is what I need to accomplish and have it perform in any page the extension is activated on. The project is as I've said to myself and to others tentatively, not terribly challenging...I'm sure I will come to regret spreading that bold-faced lie (I do), hence the title of the next section. Nevertheless, I've decided to run with that (bad) assumption as it now effortlessly rolls out of my mouth whenever I'm discussing this project. Tesseract is doing the heavy lifting after all; there are numerous lines of code that make up the API that regardless of the accuracy of the output (not always very good), it still is in my opinion sort of code magic! Yes, I know OCR scanning has been around for ages, it's not machine learning, AI, a self driving car or anything hot and trendy but it is still a cool thing.
